# 🌍 Country Management Service – Spring Data JPA 
---
This Spring Boot application demonstrates CRUD operations for managing country data using Spring Data JPA and MySQL. All requirements from Hands-on Tasks 5 through 9 have been implemented successfully and tested using a service class.

## ✅ Hands-on Task Summary
---
## 🧪 Hands-on 5: Hibernate Configuration and Data Initialization
- Configured spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate to ensure schema verification at startup.
- Added data.sql to populate the country table with real-world country data.
- Ensured schema matches the Country entity and database table exactly.
- Verified that the country table exists to avoid SchemaValidationException.


---


## 🔍 Hands-on 6: Find Country by Code
- Created a custom exception CountryNotFoundException under service.exception.
- Added the method:


   public Country findCountryByCode(String code) throws CountryNotFoundException {
        return countryRepository.findById(code)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new CountryNotFoundException("Country not found"));
    }


- Wrapped repository access in an Optional and threw exception if country not found.
- Wrote a test method getAllCountriesTest() inside Application.java and invoked it via main() to validate lookup by "IN".
- private static void getAllCountriesTest() throws CountryNotFoundException {
}

## Hands-on 7: Add a New Country
Implemented:

 public void addCountry(Country country) {
    }

- Used countryRepository.save() to persist a new country record.
- Wrote testAddCountry() to insert and validate a new entry ("XX" - Xanadu) in the database.


---


## Hands-on 8: Update Country Name
- Added:

public void updateCountry(String code, String name){
}

- Used findById() to retrieve the existing country and updated its name using setName(), followed by save().
- Verified the update with testUpdateCountry() which modified "XX" to "Xenovia".


---
---


## Hands-on 9: Delete Country
- Implemented:

public void deleteCountry(String code){
}

- Used countryRepository.deleteById(code) to remove a country.
- Verified deletion in testDeleteCountry() using a follow-up lookup.

## Tech Stack
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL Database
- Hibernate ORM
- Maven
- SLF4J Logging


---


## Tests & Output
- All operations are logged using SLF4J. You can observe:
-- SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE Hibernate queries
Test validation logs like:
- Hibernate: select c1_0.co_code,c1_0.co_name from country c1_0 where c1_0.co_code=?
- Hibernate: insert into country (co_name,co_code) values (?,?)
- Hibernate: update country set co_name=? where co_code=?
- Hibernate: delete from country where co_code=?

## How to Run
- Ensure MySQL is running and database is created.
- Update application.properties with your DB credentials.
- Place data.sql in src/main/resources.
- Run using your IDE or:


mvn clean spring-boot:run
